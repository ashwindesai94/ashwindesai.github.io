      <h2>AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery</h2>
      <img src="Picture3.jpg" alt="AI">
      <p>Our research in AI-accelerated drug discovery integrates cheminformatics, QSAR modeling, molecular docking, and deep learning. We work on multi-ligand docking strategies, leveraging transformer-based architectures (like BERT and GPT) trained on SMILES to predict activity, selectivity, and toxicity of small molecules. These methods are applied to targets like HDAC, BCL-2, and MPOX proteins, facilitating the design of synergistic drug combinations.</p>
